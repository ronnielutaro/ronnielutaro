<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Ronnie ðŸ‘‹</h1>

### About Me

Iâ€™m passionate about creating products that donâ€™t just work. For me, it's about translating real user needs into Products that deliver business value. I'm very obsessed about what makes Great products standout. Building products and telling their stories is something I live for. I believe Great Products not only work but also empower users with a new superpower. Thatâ€™s what drives my current work in MarTech and AdTech innovation, where Iâ€™m building tools that help businesses reduce ad waste, automate growth, and unlock new performance potential.

Beyond technology, Iâ€™m equally drawn to storytelling and documentary filmmaking, capturing the real, human side of stories that shape Africa. I believe that while technology scales systems, storytelling scales truth.

Over the past 5+ years, I've worked across Product Development, Venture Building, Startup Incubation & Acceleration, helping founders turn ideas into scalable ventures. 

You can find more of my reflections, learnings, and behind-the-scenes stories on [ronnielutaro.com](ronnielutaro.com), my space to document the journey of building, learning, and storytelling, because my wish is that what I discover along the way doesnâ€™t die with me.
