### About Me

7+ years across technical product development and strategy, turning ambitious ideas into measurable business outcomes. 

At StartHub currently, I lead implementation of high-impact innovation and venture-building programs that help early-stage founders develop scalable products, gain real customers, and grow sustainable revenue. I work closely with universities, partners, and ecosystem actors to build entrepreneurial capacity and deliver measurable results. 

I also work on Rocketize, currently still a side-project aimed at building MarTech/AdTech solutions for Marketing Teams in Africa.
