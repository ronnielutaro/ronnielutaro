### About Me

Iâ€™m a Product Leader currently working in the innovation education industry across East Africa to unlock entrepreneurial potential. My work sits at the intersection of product strategy, user research, and systems design, turning ambitious ideas into scalable, high-impact learning products.

Whether Iâ€™m launching a new training program, building ecosystem capacity, or optimizing learner journeys, my focus is always the same: deliver products that are contextual, scalable, and drive real outcomes. I bring a mix of strategy, systems thinking, and technical background to every challenge I take on. My product thinking is shaped by my roots in software development, working as a software engineer, building technology product across the entire stack, from frontend to backend. Equipping me with a solid foundation in creating solutions that solve real-world problems for users.
