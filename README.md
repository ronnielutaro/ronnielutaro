<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Ronnie 👋</h1>

### About Me

Over the past 5+ years, I've worked across Technical Product Development and Startup Acceleration. My experience in Product Strategy, Project Management, and Artificial Intelligence underpin my ability to deliver impactful solutions to complex challenges. 

I specialize in bridging the gap between emerging technologies and business growth. Over the past 3+ years, I’ve supported 100+ founders across Uganda and Tanzania, helping teams launch products that have generated UGX 10M+ in revenue. My approach focuses on translating core user needs into Products that generate real business value.

When I'm not building Technology or working on Projects, you'll find me exploring ideas or writing via "Builders & Creators" --> a newsletter (ronnielutaro.com) sharing frontline insights on East African innovation. I believe that while technology scales systems, storytelling scales truth.
