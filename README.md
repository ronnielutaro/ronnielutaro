<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Ronnie 👋</h1>

### About Me

Over the past 5+ years, I've worked across Technology Innovation, Product Development, and Startup Acceleration. Now as Founder and Software Engineer @RocketizeTech, I lead applied AI research and product development to create Market Intelligence tools for marketing teams. These tools aim to reduce ad waste, automate growth, and enable data-driven campaign strategies across multiple channels. My expertise in product strategy and ideation underpins my ability to deliver impactful solutions to complex challenges.

Beyond technology, I’m equally drawn to storytelling and filmmaking, capturing the real, human side of stories that shape Africa. I believe that while technology scales systems, storytelling scales truth. So when I'm not building technology, you'll find me screenwriting, storyboarding, editting scenes or exploring ideas.
