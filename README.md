<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Ronnie ðŸ‘‹</h1>

### About Me

Product Manager with 4+ years of product work and a software engineering background. I translate user needs into Products they deeply love and care about.

My sweet spot is at the intersection of core user needs and data-driven product iteration. Iâ€™m comfortable working with technical product teams, thanks to hands-on experience in C#/.NET, React, SQL, and Microsoft Azure.

Currently at StartHub, I've supported more than 10 founders with product development, from idea to Market: running customer discovery interviews with real users, turning those insights into requirements and features. On the side, Iâ€™m also building Rocketize, a side-project where I run end-to-end (full-stack) product development cycles (interviews â†’ PRDs â†’ Design â†’ Engineering â†’ Testing and iteration based on real user feedback & behavior analytics using tools like PostHog).
