<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Ronnie ðŸ‘‹</h1>

### About Me

With 5+ years of experience across **technical product development, business development, early-stage startup incubation & acceleration**, Iâ€™ve helped 100+ founders across East Africa move from idea to market, building real products, acquiring customers, and growing revenue.

Currently at **[StartHub Africa](https://starthubafrica.org/)**, I lead programs that turn ideas into scalable businesses by working closely with universities, innovation hubs, and ecosystem partners. My past work includes designing and building software products, training young women in STEM as a consultant under the [UN Womenâ€™s African Girls Can Code Initiative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_YCW32Up7o) and building logistics and geospatial data tools for infrastructure development, equipping me with a solid foundation in creating solutions that solve real-world problems.

**What Iâ€™m Currently Building:** Campaign Rocket AI - A new class of core Advertising Technology (AdTech) Infrastructure for African markets, helping advertisers and agencies unlock smarter campaign intelligence, automation, and performance at scale without bloated costs or complexity. The Tools aim to fully:
- Boost campaign efficiency.
- Reduce budget waste & maximize ROI/ROAS.
- Unlock new possibilities in programmatic advertising. 

Iâ€™m passionate about enabling real progress through products, people, and platforms.
