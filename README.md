<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Ronnie ðŸ‘‹</h1>

### About Me

7+ years across product development, strategy, growth, and technical execution, turning ambitious ideas into measurable business outcomes. 

At StartHub, Iâ€™ve led programs such as ABED (150+ youth trained; 20+ agribusiness ventures), and the Innovation Hub Manager Masterclass (regional learning series), working with universities and ecosystem partners to drive real traction for founders.

Previously: designed and delivered STEM programs with UN Womenâ€™s African Girls Can Code Initiative (200+ participants), plus hands-on software development in logistics & infrastructure.

During my spare time, I work on Rocketize, a MarTech & AdTech side-project aimed at building solutions that help African Businesses cut Ad waste and maximize Growth & ROI.

I blend product strategy, experiment-driven growth, and a hands-on software engineering background to ship contextual, scalable products, backed by clean KPIs and fast feedback loops.
