<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Ronnie 👋</h1>

### About Me

I’m passionate about creating products that don’t just work. For me, it's about translating real user needs into Products that deliver Business Value. I'm very obsessed about what makes Great products standout. I believe Great Products empower users with a new superpower. That’s what drives my current work in Programmatic Advertising Innovation, where I’m building Market Intelligence tools that help businesses & Marketing Teams reduce ad waste, automate growth, and unlock new performance potential.

Beyond technology, I’m equally drawn to storytelling and documentary filmmaking, capturing the real, human side of stories that shape Africa. I believe that while technology scales systems, storytelling scales truth.

Over the past 5+ years, I've worked across Product Development, Venture Building, Startup Incubation & Acceleration, helping founders turn ideas into scalable ventures. 

You can find more of my reflections, learnings, and behind-the-scenes stories on [ronnielutaro.com](ronnielutaro.com), my space to document the journey of building, learning, and storytelling, because my wish is that what I discover along the way doesn’t die with me.
