<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Ronnie 👋</h1>

### About Me

Over the past 5+ years, I've worked across Technology Innovation, Product Development, and Startup Acceleration. My expertise in Product Strategy, Project Management, and Software Engineering underpins my ability to deliver impactful solutions to complex challenges. I'm very passionate about digital transformation, emerging technologies and how they can enhance business performance. 

I've supported more than 50 founders across 2 different countries with Product Development & Go-To-Market. My approach focuses on translating core user needs into Products that generate real business value.

Beyond the technology, I’m equally drawn to storytelling, capturing the real stories that shape Human Experiences. I believe that while technology scales systems, storytelling scales truth. When I'm not building Technology or working on Projects, you'll find me writing or exploring ideas.
