<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Ronnie 👋</h1>

### About Me

Over the past 8+ years, I've worked across Technical Product Development, Project Management, Data Science & Analytics, in different industries like Startup Incubation & Acceleration, Venture Building, and Digital Advertising Technology (AdTech). This underpins my ability to deliver impactful solutions to complex challenges.

Currently very passionate & obsessed with deeply understanding what drives real consumer behavior & buying decisions, beyond the obvious surface-level indicators. I'm on a mission to help a Million Businesses Enhance performance, and over the past 3+ years, I’ve supported 100+ founders across Uganda and Tanzania, helping teams launch products & generate more than UGX 10M+ in revenue while working with Eco-system players like StartHub Africa, National ICT Innovation Hub, RUFORUM, UN Women, Stanbic Bank, UNDP, Mastercard Foundation, among others.

When I'm not building Technology or working on Projects, you'll find me exploring ideas or writing. I believe that while technology scales systems, storytelling scales truth.
