<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Ronnie ðŸ‘‹</h1>

### About Me

For over 5 years, I have helped Businesses Maximize Growth through **Product Strategy, Product Development** & **Advertising Technology (AdTech)** in African Markets.

At **[StartHub Africa](https://starthubafrica.org/)**, I lead innovation & venture-building projects, helping early-stage founders develop scalable products, secure customers, and drive revenue growth. To date, Iâ€™ve worked on projects that have supported **100+ youth founders & startups**, guiding them from idea generation to market readiness.

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer & Consultant with leading organizations & companies like Andela, United Nations (UN Women) and early-stage startups such as Agri-Logistics Uganda. My experience includes leading the design and development of software products, equipping me with a solid foundation in creating solutions that solve real-world problems.

### Current Focus Areas

Iâ€™m currently exploring how **Advertising Technology (AdTech)** can empower Small to Medium size African Agencies to:
- Boost campaign efficiency & automate painful workflows
- Optimize Ad spend in real-time & reduce budget waste 
- Unlock new possibilities in programmatic advertising  

> Through R&D, Iâ€™m developing tools to help agencies work smarter, grow faster, and scale sustainably without bloated costs or complexity.
