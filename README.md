<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Ronnie ðŸ‘‹</h1>

### About Me

Product Manager with 4+ years of product work and a software engineering background. I translate user needs into Products they deeply love and care about while delivering business value. 

At StartHub, Iâ€™ve supported 50+ founders across 2 different countries from idea to market by running deep customer discovery loops, translating insights into requirements and features, and closing the loop with post-launch iteration. Iâ€™m also building Rocketize, a side project where I run end-to-end product cycles. The project is aimed at building a suite of intelligent tools for Marketing Teams to streamline & improve the efficiency of their marketing campaign operations, while reducing Waste & maximizing Return On Ad Spend.

Read more on my personal blog where I write my thoughts, learnings, reflections & stories from behind the scenes on projects I'm working on at [ronnielutaro.com](ronnielutaro.com). My wish is that what I learn or discover along the way doesn't die with me.
