<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Ronnie ðŸ‘‹</h1>

### About Me

Product Manager with 4+ years of product work and a software engineering background. I translate user needs into Products they deeply love and care about. 

At StartHub, Iâ€™ve supported 10+ founders from idea to market by running customer discovery, translating insights into requirements and features, and closing the loop with post-launch iteration. Iâ€™m also building Rocketize, a side project where I run end-to-end product cycles. The project is aimed at building a suite of intelligent tools for Marketing Teams to streamline & improve the efficiency of their marketing campaign operations, while reducing Waste & maximizing Return On Ad Spend.

Read more on my personal website where I share my thoughts, write about projects that I'm working on, and all major lessons, reflections & stories along the way at [ronnielutaro.com](ronnielutaro.com). I love storytelling & that's why I share everything behind the scenes.
