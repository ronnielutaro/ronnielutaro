<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Ronnie 👋</h1>

### About Me

Over the past 5+ years, I've worked across Technical Product Development and Startup Acceleration. My experience in Product Strategy, Project Management, and Business Intelligence underpin my ability to deliver impactful solutions to complex challenges. 

I'm on a mission to help a Million Businesses Enhance performance through Autonomation. Over the past 3+ years, I’ve supported 100+ founders across Uganda and Tanzania, helping teams launch products & generate more than UGX 10M+ in revenue while working with StartHub Africa. My approach focuses on translating core user needs into Products that generate real business value.

When I'm not building Technology or working on Projects, you'll find me exploring ideas or writing via "Builders & Creators" --> a newsletter (ronnielutaro.com) I started that focuses on sharing insights towards Building the African Tech Revolution. I believe that while technology scales systems, storytelling scales truth.
