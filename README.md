<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Ronnie 👋</h1>

### About Me

Over the past 5+ years, I've worked across Technical Product Development and Startup Acceleration. My experience in Product Strategy, Project Management, and Artificial Intelligence underpin my ability to deliver impactful solutions to complex challenges. 

I specialize in bridging the gap between emerging technologies and business growth. Over the past 3+ years, I’ve supported 100+ founders across Uganda and Tanzania, helping teams launch products that have generated UGX 10M+ in revenue. My approach focuses on translating core user needs into Products that generate real business value.

Beyond the technology, I’m equally drawn to storytelling, capturing the real stories that shape Human Experiences. I believe that while technology scales systems, storytelling scales truth. When I'm not building Technology or working on Projects, you'll find me writing or exploring ideas.
