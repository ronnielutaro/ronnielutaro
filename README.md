<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Ronnie 👋</h1>

### About Me

Over the past 5+ years, I've worked across Product Development, Digital Transformation, and Startup Acceleration. My experience in Product Strategy, Project Management, Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain and Software Engineering underpin my ability to deliver impactful solutions to complex challenges. I'm very passionate about digital transformation, emerging technologies and how they can enhance business performance. I specialize in helping organizations navigate Digital Transformation by bridging the gap between Technology, Business Efficiency & Growth.

I've supported more than 50 founders across 2 different countries with Product Development & Go-To-Market Strategy. My approach focuses on translating core user needs into Products that generate real business value.

Beyond the technology, I’m equally drawn to storytelling, capturing the real stories that shape Human Experiences. I believe that while technology scales systems, storytelling scales truth. When I'm not building Technology or working on Projects, you'll find me writing or exploring ideas.
