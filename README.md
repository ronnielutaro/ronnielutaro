<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Ronnie 👋</h1>

### About Me

For over 7 years, I have helped Businesses and Organizations Maximize Impact & ROI across **Digital Transformation**, **Data-Driven Project Management**, and **Venture Building**.

At **[StartHub Africa](https://starthubafrica.org/)**, I lead innovation & venture-building projects, helping early-stage founders develop scalable products, secure customers, and drive revenue growth. To date, I’ve worked on projects that have supported **100+ startups**, guiding them from idea generation to market readiness.

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer & Consultant with leading organizations & companies like Andela, United Nations (UN Women) and early-stage startups such as Agri-Logistics Uganda. My experience includes leading the design and development of software products, equipping me with a solid foundation in creating solutions that solve real-world problems.

### Current Focus Areas

I’m currently exploring how **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Advertising Technology (AdTech)** can empower African businesses to:
- Optimize Ad spend in real-time  
- Boost campaign efficiency & reduce budget waste  
- Unlock new possibilities in programmatic advertising  

> Through R&D, I’m developing **AI-driven AdTech tools tailored for Africa** to enhance business performance, reduce costs, and scale growth.
