### About Me

I translate user needs into Products that deliver business value. I'm very obsessed about what makes Great products standout. Building products and telling their stories is something I live for. Because I believe Great Products not only solve deep customer problems and needs but also empower users with a new superpower. For the past 5+ years, I've worked across Technical Product Development, Venture Building, Startup Incubation & Acceleration.
