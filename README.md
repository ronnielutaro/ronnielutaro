<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Ronnie 👋</h1>

### About Me

Over the past 8+ years, I've worked across Technical Product Development, Project Management, and Data Science, in different industries like Startup Incubation & Acceleration, Innovation Support, Venture Building, Growth Marketing and Advertising (AdTech). This underpins my ability to deliver impactful solutions to complex challenges.

I'm on a mission to help a Million Businesses Enhance performance through Automation & Business Intelligence. Over the past 3+ years, I’ve supported 100+ founders across Uganda and Tanzania, helping teams launch products & generate more than UGX 10M+ in revenue while working with StartHub Africa. My approach focuses on translating core user needs into Products that generate real business value.

When I'm not building Technology or working on Projects, you'll find me exploring ideas or writing. I believe that while technology scales systems, storytelling scales truth.
