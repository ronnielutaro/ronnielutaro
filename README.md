<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Ronnie ðŸ‘‹</h1>

### About Me

I build scalable innovation and growth systems that drive tangible business outcomes across Africaâ€™s technology, entrepreneurship, and digital transformation ecosystems.

With 5+ years of experience across product development and startup acceleration Iâ€™ve helped 100+ founders across East Africa move from idea to market, building real products, acquiring customers, and generating revenue.

Currently at **[StartHub Africa](https://starthubafrica.org/)**, I lead programs that turn early-stage ideas into scalable businesses by working closely with universities, innovation hubs, and ecosystem partners. From guiding students to launch revenue-generating startups, to training innovation hub managers across East Africa, my focus is always on one thing: turning potential into tangible business outcomes. 

Before this, I worked as a software engineer at Andela, Agri-Logistics Uganda, and as a consultant with the United Nations (UN Women), where I trained over 120 young women in practical coding and digital innovation as part of the [African Girls Can Code Initiative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_YCW32Up7o).

Whether itâ€™s building products or enabling youth entrepreneurship through innovation ecosystems, I bring a mix of strategy, systems thinking, and technical background to every challenge I take on. If you're working on something exciting in African markets, from youth innovation to digital infrastructure, **Letâ€™s Connect!** [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronnie-lutaro-b73240aa/), [Portfolio](https://ronnielutaro.com), [Email](mailto:ronnielutaro@outlook.com)
